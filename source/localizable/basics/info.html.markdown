# The Skeleton

Every new project creates a basic web development skeleton for you. This
automates the construction of a standard hierarchy of folders and files that
you can use in all of your projects.

A brand-new project will contain a `source` folder and a `config.rb` file. The
source folder is where you will build your website. The skeleton project
contains folders for JavaScript, CSS and images, but you can change these to
match your own personal preferences.

The `config.rb` file contains [settings for Middleman][settings].
